## Current monitoring coverage

The social listener currently monitors 8 priority countries:

* Spain
* United Kingdom
* United States
* Brazil
* Germany
* Taiwan
* China
* Portugal

The daily scans focus on future events and public/social-web signals where people may be looking for accommodation support, hotel sharing, room sharing, group stays, cheaper options, or event-related travel help.

Current monitored platforms include:

* Facebook
* Instagram
* TikTok
* Telegram

Reddit monitoring is prepared but remains inactive until Reddit credentials are added.

## Reliability notes

* The system runs in two daily batches to reduce timeout risk and keep the scans reliable.
* Priority events are filtered so the scanner focuses on future events rather than past events.
* The scanner looks for public/searchable event posts, group pages, social captions, discussion-style signals, and accommodation-related intent.
* Private groups, locked accounts, hidden comments, or login-only platform content may not be accessible without additional platform credentials or scraper integrations.
* New signal URLs are only marked as known after Slack confirms the batch was processed.
* If Slack posting fails, the system avoids marking those leads as completed so they can be retried.
* Qualified leads are posted into Slack with the country, platform, lead type, score, reason, suggested action, and original source link.
